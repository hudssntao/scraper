`All things scraping.`

Testing out webscraping tools (Note: Moved intern/nih around so they may be broken):
Scrapes Pubmed for contact information based on keyword search.

1. `Internship scraper` -- Scraped SBIR Seed Fund website for internship leads.

- 2 solid internship offers out of 150 emails sent
- Around 5 warm leads I didn't pursue
- 1 internship that I accepted, though ironically the scraper didn't get it for me directly. It was talking about the scraper that led to this opportunity!

2. `NIH scraper` -- Letting AI take the wheel (in progress)

3. `Pubmed scraper` -- Classic scraping with Pubmed API for LifeSct LLC
